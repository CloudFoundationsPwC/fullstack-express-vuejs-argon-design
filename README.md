### What is [Express](https://expressjs.com/)

For newcomers, [Express](https://expressjs.com/) is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. Read more about **Express** [here](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html)

<br />

### What is [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)

[Vue](https://vuejs.org/) (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries. Read more about **Vue** [here](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)

<br />

### [Vue Argon Design](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/vue-argon-design-system)

Start your development with a Design System for Bootstrap 4. It is open source, free and it features many components that can help you create amazing websites. **Vue Argon Design** is built with over 100 individual components, giving you the freedom of choosing and combining. All components can take variations in colour, that you can easily modify using SASS files. Read more about **Vue Argon Design** [here](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/vue-argon-design-system)
